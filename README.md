# flutter_learn

A step by step flutter learning project for developers.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.
###Key Points
1. In flutter every view is a widget.
2. Widget are two types: i) Stateless ii) Stateful
3. Main app is always a Stateless widget

###Stateless Widget
The widget which do not have a state.
The widget (View) who never changes at runtime.
Ex. Text('Learn Flutter')
Here Text() widget never updated so its a Stateless widget. Its render only based on parameter values one time.
Ex2. LearningApp widget at main.dart in this app is a Stateless widget.
why?
Learning app renders one time and never gets updated during runtime at this point. There is no user interaction with ui for now. So view creates one time and never changes. 

###Stateful widget
Will learn from next commit
